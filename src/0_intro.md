# Introduction

This workshop will provide an overview of how to use the Hawaiʻi Groundwater Recharge Tool and its features. This tool provides users the ability to view the potential impacts land-cover modifications may have on groundwater-recharge rates for the island of Oʻahu.

Groundwater-recharge data are pre-computed for each land-cover type and rainfall scenario combination. The groundwater-recharge data are stored in a database and retrieved when changes are made in the application.

The tool provides data for 30 different land-cover types, represented by a corresponding  numeric code, available [here](https://recharge.ikewai.org/#/land_cover_table) and two rainfall scenarios:

* Baseline rainfall - based on rainfall data observed for 1978-2007
* Rainfall projection RCP 8.5 - based on a potential rainfall projection for 2041-2070

Please go to [The Hawaiʻi Groundwater Recharge Tool](https://recharge.ikewai.org/#/workspace) to follow along and try it out for yourself.
