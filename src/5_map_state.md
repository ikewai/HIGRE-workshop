The state of a map can be exported from the application by exporting the custom area and land-cover from the map.

Click the export button and select the "Custom Area (as Shapefile) and "Land Cover" options. The groundwater-recharge data can also be exported by selecting the "Recharge" option. This cannot be imported to the application, but can be used for external analysis. Click "Export". This will download a zip folder containing the requested files.

This can then be used to recreate a map by going to the import dialog, selecting "Import Shapefile" and "Import Land Cover Raster" and selecting the zip folder that was exported from the application.
